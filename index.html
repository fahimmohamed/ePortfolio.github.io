        <h3>About myself</h3>

        I'm Sec 4 student currently studying in St. Patrick's School. I take an 8-subject combination which comprises of Pure Physics, Chemistry and Computing. I was always fascinated by new technologies. The fact that our smartphones have the ability to receive an input and process things motivated me to dive deeper and discover the digital world. Technology will shape our futures and I would like to be a part of it!

        <h3>How I developed my passion in IT</h3> 
        I have had a keen interest in computers since young. My Uncle, who is working as an IT Professional, has introduced me to the world of computers. Everytime I meet him, he would deliver updates on the latest IoT devices and programmes. He was on of the key reasons for my special aptitude in Informtion Technology.
